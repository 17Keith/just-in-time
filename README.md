# just-in-time

Check out the repository, it is my trial for my last Portfolio in ALX-SE curriculum. 

The web app is created using the MERN stack. MongoDB and Express/Node.js for the backend, and the user/client side is made using React. 

The app is not in it's final form, as it is a little bit buggy in some of the components. I will update in time. 

Feedback is well appreciated.
